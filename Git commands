git checkout (src/...) is how you move back to a file before the change took place IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY ADDED IT THE THE STAGING AREA

git reset HEAD (src/...) will reset a commit thats already been staged then follow up with a git checkout to retrieve the correct file version

git checkout HEAD^ (src/...) will undo last commit after file has been added to staging area

git reset --hard HEAD^  will get back to not the current commit but the previous commit the current commit you are on will no longer be there
